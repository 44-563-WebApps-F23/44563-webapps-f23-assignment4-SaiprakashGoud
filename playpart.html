        (ASLAKSEN appears at the door. He is poorly but decently dressed, in
black, with a slightly crumpled white neckcloth; he wears gloves and
has a felt hat in his hand.)<br>

Aslaksen (bowing). Excuse my taking the liberty, Doctor— <br>

Dr. Stockmann (getting up). Ah, it is you, Aslaksen!<br>

Aslaksen. Yes, Doctor.<br>

Hovstad (standing up). Is it me you want, Aslaksen?<br>

Aslaksen. No; I didn't know I should find you here. No, it was the
Doctor I—<br>

Dr. Stockmann. I am quite at your service. What is it?<br>

Aslaksen. Is what I heard from Mr. Billing true, sir—that you mean to
improve our water supply?<br>

Dr. Stockmann. Yes, for the Baths.
